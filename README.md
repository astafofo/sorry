# New way to Say sorry to your friend :(

Thank you to [@mewtru](https://instagram.com/mewtru) for the video idea!

This code was completely created from scratch! utilising Tailwind CSS!

This website allows you to ask the big question, "I'm sorry for not being able to speak :(" in a unique and playful manner. With cute GIFs that change with responses and dynamic "Yes" and "No" buttons, it's designed to bring a smile and possibly a "Yes!" to someone special.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: Engage with "Yes" and "No" buttons that dynamically respond to user input.
- **Cute GIFs**: Enjoy a selection of heartwarming GIFs that change based on the user's interaction.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Stylish design and responsive layout powered by Tailwind CSS for a modern and mobile-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript Magic**: Experience the joy of interaction with JavaScript that brings the website to life.

## How It Works

- The user is greeted with a cute GIF and the question "I'm sorry for not being able to speak :(".
- Responding "No" modifies the size and text of the buttons, adding a playful element to convince the user to reconsider.
- A "Yes" click celebrates the moment with a special GIF and triggers a confetti animation, hiding the response buttons.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/notharly/Sorry.git
   ```
3. Open ```index.html``` in your browser to view the website.

No additional setup is required, as Tailwind CSS is included via CDN and JavaScript is embedded within the HTML.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- [canvas-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti) for the confetti effect
